- Project name:
     Late Night Chess
- Project description: 
    This project was made to showcase the short film " What Connects us: Late night Chess" As the video carries a silly story, so does the website. The film shows a bond being made by the two actors through a game of chess including a impossible check-mate move. The soundtrack of the film could be no other then the classical victorious anthem "Rocky". Enjoy!
- Process:
    As I submitted the website later, together with the website, I made the short film already thinking on possible layouts for the web page.
    As I didnt had much of an experience with coding using HTML and CSS, I watched several tutotials on them; and I ended up using them for almost all of the website.
    I Also did the wirefrime in the middle of the process of making the website, which helped me think more about what could be practical and usefull designs.


- Reflection / evaluation:

    It was overall a fun, but very hard process. 
    Im satisfied with the overall look and functionalities of the webpage, and Im certainly happy with the new skills gained in the process.

//Still have to add the video file to the page
